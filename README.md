## Introduction

The Graphs Program is a Java implementation of a graph data structure. It includes functionality for adding vertices, directed edges, and various graph traversal algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Features

- **Graph Implementation:** A flexible graph implementation supporting directed edges and associated data.
- **Traversal Algorithms:** Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path.
- **Testing Support:** Utilities for testing the correctness of the implemented algorithms.
- **CallBack Interface:** Interface for processing vertices during graph traversal.
- **PrintCallBack:** Processor for appending vertex names and data to a result string during traversal.

## Usage

To use the graph implementation and algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/graphs-program.git
